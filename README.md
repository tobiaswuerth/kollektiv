I'd like to experiment with AI agents.

I see a lot of interesting aspects in a project like this, ranging from interactions with LLMs, to RAG, system lifecycles, virtual environments and much more.

The goal is:
- have a team of agents
- each agent has a persona with certain characteristics, skills and access to tools
- the agents interact with each other, trying to solve a common problem
